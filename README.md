# han-tracker
I will be tracking all my learning with the help of a display piece that includes all the technologies I learned so far. 

# Notes
1. Use python for major setup.
2. HTML, CSS, JS and other full-stack technologies to visualize the content.
3. Create individual folders for each technology to be practised.
4. Use the least-privilige policy.
5. Plan an AI project.
6. .NET, Java, DE focused projects plan.
7. Post all the updates in readme. But can plan a jira board to later track these projects.
